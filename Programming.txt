---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVERSE ENGINEERING OF THE EVOLIS PRIMACY PRINTER DRIVER AND RIBBON VERIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------
PROJECT GOAL
-------------


---------------------------------
CONNECTING TO THE SERIAL PROTOCOL
---------------------------------
Enabling the serial port ( it's deactivated by default ) using the printer
command tool

(ESC)Pcom;1;9600;N;1;0;E;R(CR)


The default settings for Evolis card printers are typically 9600 baud,
8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and hardware flow control.

The command syntax for Evolis card printers is defined as follows:

[*]
`(Start Character) Command (separator) parameter 1 (separator) parameter n (Stop Character)`

	Start Character: ESC (ASCII code 27)
	Separator: ; (semicolon)
	Stop Character: CR (ASCII code 13)

[*]
Construct the Command: For example, to download a compressed color bitmap, the command would be

(ESC)Dbc;p1;p2;p3;p4;xxxx(CR)

[*]
p1: Color panel (y for yellow, m for magenta, c for cyan, k for black, o for overlay)

p2: Resolution (2 for 2 levels of gray, 32 for 32 levels of gray, 64 for 64 levels of gray,
    128 for 128 levels of gray)

p3: Number of bytes to follow

p4: Data to be downloaded
